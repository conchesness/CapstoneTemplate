### Before we begin ###

This assumes you have: 
1) Installed Visual Studio Code. (Which is what you are using to look at this file now)
2) installed Git (https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
    Git *NOT* github desktop.
4) Installed Anaconda - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
5) Setup your secrets.py file inside the utils folder with your MongoDB credentials and
    your Google Project credentials

#### Set VSC Default Terminal to cmd.exe (windows only) #####

Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code. If it is not
already open then go to the Terminal menu and choose "New Terminal". Check in the bottom right corner to see 
if the terminal is set to "cmd". (zsh for Mac) If it is not, pull down the 
terminal menu which is a little down pointing arrow next to the '+' at the top right of the 
terminal window in VSC. Choose "select default profile" then pick "Command Prompt" (or zsh for Mac)
Then click the trash can next to any open termnal listed at the far right in the terminal 
window pane. Then open a new terminal by going to the Terminal menu at the top of the screen.

#### Install the Python Extension in VSC  ####

1) Click the extensions icon on the left side of the screen. It looks like 4
    squares.
2) Search for and install the Python extension. It is the one created by Microsoft.
 You can also install it from this link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python

##### Create a Python Environment for your project #####
1) in the terminal you should see (base) at the begining of the command prompt.
    this means you have anaconda installed and are using the "base" environment. If you
    don't see base,  click the view menu, then go to the Comppand Palettte then search for 
    "python: Select Interpreter". Choose the one that is called "base".  Hopefully you should
    now see (base)
2) type these command to create a new environment for this project. Replace <yourProjectName> 
    with the name of your project.

    conda create --name <yourProjectName> python=3
    conda activate <yourProjectName>

3) now you want to set this to your default environment for this project. go to the View menu 
    above and choose Command Palette...
4) Search for 'Python: Select Interpreter' and choose the environment you just created.
    If you don't see it click the refresh arrow in the top left of the envirnment list window.
5) This project should now default to that environment and you should see it at the 
    begining of the command prompt.

##### Install the Python Packages #####
##### Deep breath, this can get messy  #####

# Now you need to install all of the python packages.  To do this, open the terminal in Visual Studio Code. 
# If it is not already open then go to the Terminal menu and choose "New Terminal". 'pip' is the 
# name of the tool that installs python packages. This next command will just check to see if you
# have pip installed. 

# MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE ENVIRONMENT YOU MADE FOR THIS PROJECT.

# Type this command
python -m pip
schMac users: python3 -m pip

# It should report back to you how to use pip. If it doesn't understand 'pip' as a 
# command then you have a bigger problem. Did you install Anaconda? Did you click the checkboxes in the instructions
# to put it in the execution path and set it as default?

# On the Internet you may see instructions to use just 'pip' and not 'python -m pip'. Don't do that.
# 'python -m pip' ('python3 -m pip' for Mac users) is better becuase it makes sure that you are 
# using the right version of pip. 

# If it is already installed lets make sure it is updated.

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
(Mac users, ugh, type: python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip)

# The next command will install all the packages that are listed in the "requirements.txt" file

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
(schMac users will type: python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt)

# if you get an error READ IT. If it says you don't have access you need to use the '--user'
# option.  See the command below.  You can add --user to any pip command.
# example: python -m pip install --user flask

# You should see several packages being downloaded and installed.
# You can check to see if it worked by clicking on the main.py to the left and then clicking the run button (triangle)
# at the top right of the screen.  

TEST YOUR PROGRESS: 
1) Click the Documents icon in the top left.
2) Find main.py, click it. You should see a play button in the top right corner.
2a) If you don't see the play button, it is probably because you do not have the VSC Python extension 
    installed. A small popup window might have shown up in the bottom right of your
    VSC screen.  Click install!  If it didn't, click the extensions icon on the far 
    left of the screen. It looks like a set of 4 squares. Search for and install 'Python'.
3) When you click play you may get some errors.  If the error says something 
    like "there is no module named xxxxx" then install the module:
        python -m pip install xxxxx 
        NOTE: if the module is named with an underscore like flask_login, when you install it,
        use a hyphen like: flask-login.
        (muck users: python3 not python) 
        (if you get an access error use --user after install)
4) run main.py again.  Keep doing this until you don't get module errors. 

### Run Main.py ###
1) Click the main.py file
2) Click the run triangle
3) Pray to the techno-gods
4) Hopefully, your site will start and be avalable at https://127.0.0.1:5000

You should be ready to go!

Run the main.py file.
